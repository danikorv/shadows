<div class="story">
    <p>In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread
    <p>a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale
    <p>course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to 
    <p>keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; 
    <p>even from without it is apparent that they are built to
    <p>create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior 
    <p>to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house
    <p>is a parasol,  the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap,
    <p>with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to
    <p>penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts
    <p>of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves.

<div class="story1">
    <p>he fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, 
    <p>for instance, made a low  roof necessary to keep off the 
    <p>driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have 
    <p>been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The
    <p>quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow 
    <p>from the realities of life,and our ancestors, forced 
    <p>to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty
    <p>in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</p>

<div class="story2">
    <p>And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room
    <p>depends on a variation of shadows heavy shadows against light 
    <p>shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity
    <p>of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft
    <p>of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays 
    <p>a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the sitting
    <p>Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but
    <p>but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the
    <p>sunlight at still greater a remove. </p>
