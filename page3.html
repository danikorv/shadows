    <p>The light from the garden steals in but dimly through,
    <p>paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect 
    <p>light that makes for us the charm of a room. 
    <p>We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, 
    <p>fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. 
    <p>The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and  such may have a 
    <p>gossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be
    <p>of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy 
    <p>the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. We delight in the 
    <p>mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface
    <p>of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them.

    <p>We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and 
    <p>these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if
    <p>we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand
    <p>in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from room to room, but the
    <p>degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference 
    <p>in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the
    <p>mood of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls,
    <p>the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.</p>

    <p>Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging 
    <p>scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers serve not as
    <p>ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a scroll above all for 
    <p>the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting 
    <p>quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece
    <p>will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work
    <p>of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to 
    <p>unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings.
